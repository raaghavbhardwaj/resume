        <p>"Aspiring Data Scientist | Passionate About Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Building Real-World Projects"</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m Raghav Bhardwaj, and I’m currently on an exciting journey to build a career in data science! As a self-driven learner with a deep curiosity about data and technology, I’ve immersed myself in learning the skills needed to analyze and interpret complex data to make informed, data-driven decisions.</p>
            
            <p>I’m currently studying Python, SQL, and machine learning through online courses and hands-on projects. I’ve been exploring tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. In particular, I’m passionate about how data can be used to solve real-world problems, and I’m especially interested in areas like predictive modeling, data analytics, and natural language processing (NLP).</p>
            
            <p>To put my learning into practice, I’m currently working on a personal project: a household service website that uses SQLite for the backend database. This project involves building a simple, user-friendly platform for customers to book household services like cleaning, repairs, and maintenance. I’m responsible for designing the database structure with SQLite to store service requests, customer details, and booking histories, and I’ve gained hands-on experience in database design, SQL queries, and web development.</p>
            
            <p>As part of this project, I’ve also been analyzing customer data to identify trends, such as the most requested services, peak booking times, and customer preferences. This has given me a chance to apply my data analysis and data visualization skills in a practical setting.</p>
            
            <p>Though I’m just starting out in data science, I’m excited to continue learning and growing. My goal is to further develop my knowledge in areas like machine learning and predictive analytics, and eventually apply these skills in real-world business problems.</p>
            
            <p>I’m always eager to connect with other data science enthusiasts, mentors, and professionals. If you have any advice, resources, or project ideas to share, feel free to reach out—I’d love to learn and collaborate!</p>
